### ABOUT ME:
Since childhood, I have been interested in technology, computers and information technology. In 2014, I graduated from university with a degree in economics. After graduation, I worked as a planning economist. But soon I decided to change the scope of activities. In the fall of 2016, I became interested in developing web sites, I really liked it, and I began to learn HTML and CSS, combining with work. A year later, I got a job at a webstudio in Minsk, at the position of the HTML-coder. After a year of work, I improved my skills, learned a lot of new things, learned new technologies and became a leading developer.
